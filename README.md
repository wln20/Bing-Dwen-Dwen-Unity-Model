# Bing-Dwen-Dwen-Unity-Model

## Introduction
This is a Bing Dwen Dwen created with Unity during my voluntary days at Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. 

Unluckily, the source code has been long lost, while I could only find the executable file and release it in this repo, in memory of those unforgettable days.

## Environment requirements
Win7+

## Usage
Unzip the released zip file and double click `BingDundun_UnityModel_wln.exe` to run the game. The model and the observer's view could both move, using WASD and up/down/left/right, respectively. Please refer to the complete user guide in the game by clicking 'H'.
